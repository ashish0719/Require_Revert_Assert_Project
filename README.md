This Solidity smart contract, division, demonstrates the use of require, assert, and revert statements to handle errors and validate conditions during execution. The contract includes two functions: divide and divideWithRevert, both performing division with different error handling techniques.

# State Variables

result: Stores the result of the division operation.
# Functions

divide(uint a, uint b)
divideWithRevert(uint a, uint b)



# Error Handling

# Assert 
assert: Used to check for conditions that should never be false. If an assert fails, it indicates a bug in the contract.
assert(result * b == a) can fail due to integer division. For example, 10 / 3 results in 3, and 3 * 3 equals 9, not 10.

# Require 
require: Checks a condition before performing the operation. If the condition fails, the function execution is stopped, and an error message is returned.

# Revert
revert: Similar to require, but can be used with custom conditions inside functions. It stops execution and returns an error message.



# Function Descriptions

divide(uint a, uint b)
This function performs division of two unsigned integers a and b. It uses require to ensure the divisor b is not zero, preventing a division by zero error. After the division, it uses assert to check that the result is as expected.

divideWithRevert(uint a, uint b)
This function also performs division but uses an if statement combined with revert to handle the division by zero error. It also uses assert to ensure the result is correct.
